Here we provide the annotation results for <em>VOC</em> and <em>COCO</em>. Every annotation file contains five columns, and the meaning of each column is as follows:

- The first column is the file name of images.
- The second to fourth columns are the annotation results of three annotators, respectively.
- The fifth column is the final annotation results after voting.
